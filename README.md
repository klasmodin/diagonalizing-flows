# Diagonalizing matrix flows
This repo contains a Python notebook for diagonalizing matrix flows, as described in a [paper by Khesin and Modin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10214) (the notebook was used to generate all the figures in that paper). Three different gradient matrix flows are studied: the Toda flow, the incompressible porous medium equation (spatially discretized via quantization), and a new diagonalizing flow that does not strive to sort the diagonal elements.
